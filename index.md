Probably all you need for your shiny new gaming PC.
## Launchers
- [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gogalaxy.com) (Windows, MacOS) -  All games in the store are DRM free. You can connect other launchers, so you have all your games in one place.
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) (Windows, Linux, MacOS) - Doesn't really need a explanation.
